Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## description

For this challenge, I created a portfolio of work to showcase my skills and talents to potential employers. The portfolio will be a living collection that I can add to over time as a gain more experience.

The portfolio satisfies the following requirements:
* When the viewer clicks the URL to my portfolio, they are presented with my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, about my work, and how to contact me;
* When the viewer clicks on a link in the navigation, they are taken to the relevant portion of the page;
* When the viewer is viewing the My Work section, they are presented with titled images of my work, the first and largest of which is the first application I worked on;
* When the viewer clicks on the images for each project, the viewer is taken to the deployed application; and
* When the viewer's viewport changes size, the design is responsive and adapts to the viewport appropriately.
